    <p class="text-block">
        Muzieh Design System is a work-in-progress design system that will allow bootstrapping modern new projects
        quickly. Css styles
        are
        intentionally minimal to keep focus on structure and less on cosmetics.

        This design system adapts <a href="https://atlassian.design/">Atlassian Design System</a>, uses <a
            href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">Tailwindcss</a> to create css components and base styles,
        and
        references <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>.

        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
            Today's web serves a wide range of audience. They may be on different devices with different operating
            systems.
            Some may use a screen reader to go along the page. Some may be less tech savvy than others. We need
            to encompass these considerations and form a purpose-driven solution that's simple,
            accessible,
            and functional.
            Grounded in this, this design system remains style-neutral and reuses what HTML has already defined as much
            as
            possible to
            leverage existing knowledge user has already accrued in the world wide web.
