    <h2>About design system</h2>
    <p>
        A design system provides a unified design language by defining a set of standards on
        styles, patterns, and components. Each decision in this system should be driven by need, purpose, and reason.
        Having a unified design language alleviates the teams from redesign, promotes consistency, and reusability.
